For this assignment, I attempted to recreate the database with the exact same structure that the MySQL database had. However, the structure of MongoDB does not lend itself to MySQL's relational model. For instance, there is no simple way to create an auto-incrementing ID in MongoDB. Several documents may be inserted at once, and MongoDB automatically generates an ObjectID for each inserted document, based on the time it was inserted and an arbitrary start value. To create an auto-incrementing ID, the user has to do one of several non-intuitive procedures, most of which will severely slow down the insertion speed. This would not be a problem if each individual patron could be searched for by its own attributes, but each patron has no primary key (and no combination of values that uniquely identify it), meaning that the ID is the only truly unique searchable part. It stands to reason that a document database like MongoDB should not be used if each individual document is not distinct from each other, if there is a need to search for an individual document.

The import process was made more frustrating by the fact that the shell included in Compass does not support running scripts. Commands have to be typed individually, which increases the likelihood of typos. In order to run scripts, you will have to download and install the shell seperately.
